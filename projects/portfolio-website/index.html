        <h2>😃 Introduction - a little bit about me</h2>
        <p>Hello~! My name is Nikita. I’m a college freshman trying to orient my major.👩‍🎓 I’m attending prerequisite courses at college, meanwhile, taking MEDA's eight-week Summer Bootcamp studying introduction to Webdesign. As a very very novice, I knew it’s a challenge for me, not only because of the intensive course pace, but also I'm an English language learner. Nevertheless, I’m interested in the computer and technology, and I want to test the water. Maybe I could make a career of it? Or maybe not? I decided to give it try. Our experienced instructor👨‍💻 made the course engaging and practical. Mentors & fellows always actively help me💕. Surrounded by this supportive vibe, I enjoyed being in this online session and my technical skills have improved beyond my expectation. Special thanks to MEDA and Eduardo👍~!</p>
