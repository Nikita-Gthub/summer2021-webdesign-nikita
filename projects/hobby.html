        <p>	My name is Nikita. Favorite interests, among many, include watching series, listening to music, hiking, photography, and sleeping. Once I was flipping through albums on my phone, and I realized that I have the hobby of capturing beautiful flowers and plants. The reason I think it's because I live in an area that vegetation flourishes all year round.</p>

        <p>I'll give you my experience of how to use your iPhone to take good pictures without any editing or additional Apps. </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Your phone must have a good camera with a decent lens.</li>
            <li>Find something unique or attractive for your eyeballs that engages you to take a close-up for it.</li>
            <li>Check if the lightning of the environment is appropriate (neither too dark nor bright) for you to take a good picture. I found my phone doesn't perform well when taking photos at night. </li>
            <li>You need to change your position in order to get a perfect angle to capture your object.</li>
            <li>Try out portrait mode to shoot indoor still-life, you may receive unexpected sharpness.</li>
            <li>Avoid pressing the photo button with a shaking hand. </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Additional tips, Apps and online resources for you to check out</h2>
        <div>
        <h3>For people <span>have done</span> this many times before, but just cannot take pictures that satisfied you.</h3>
        <p>I'd like to share Two other tips that might be helpful for you. Tip 1, if you don't want to take outdoor pictures, you can create your own photoshop studio at home by grabbing some of your favorite gadgets together. It doesn't need to be fancy, just be innovative and fits your personal aesthetic insight. Tip 2, find the room in your house that has the most light. Again, if you don't want the follow-up work, adequate lighting is essential for you to take good photos. </p>
