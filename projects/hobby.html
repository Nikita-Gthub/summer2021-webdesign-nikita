        <p>	My name is Nikita. Favorite interests, among many, include watching series, listening to music, hiking, photography, and sleeping. Once I was flipping through albums on my phone, and I realized that I have the hobby of capturing beautiful flowers and plants. The reason I think it's because I live in an area that vegetation flourishes all year round.</p>

        <h2>Instructions on how to do my hobby</h2>
        <h3>For someone that has never done this before</h3>
        <p>I'll give you my experience of how to use your iPhone to take good pictures without any editing or additional Apps. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>You need a phone with a decent camera. </li>
            <li>Find something that attracts your eyes and you would like to take a close-up.</li>
            <li>Check if the environment has an appropriate light for you to take a good picture. (One thing I found from iPhone is that it doesn't perform well when taking photos at night. )</li>
            <li>Choose a perfect angle to capture your subject.</li>
            <li>Avoid pressing the photo button with a shaking hand. </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Additional tips, Apps and online resources for you to check out</h2>
        <h3>For people have done this many times before, but just cannot take pictures that satisfied you.</h3>
        <p>I'd like to share Two other tips that might be helpful for you. Tip 1, if you don't want to take outdoor pictures, you can create your own photoshop studio at home by grabbing some of your favorite gadgets together. It doesn't need to be fancy, just be innovative and fits your personal aesthetic insight. Tip 2, find the room in your house that has the most light. Again, if you don't want the follow-up work, adequate lighting is essential for you to take good photos. </p>
